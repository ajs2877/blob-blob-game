Blob-Blob Game | 6/19/2021

All tiles, blobs, everything that exists in the game space is given the GridObject script at the topmost gameobject.
This script is what snaps and adds the gameobject to the TrueGrid script that exists for every stage.
The GridObject also holds how big the element is and this should always be made sure to be correct as it is heavily used in movement/grid systems.

Highlighting triggerables and doors works by having the player hold the HighlightingController script.
Then when a player enters a triggable tile, the class will look into the tile's Triggerable script and grab its list of reciever gameobjects.
Then it will spawn a highlight for every one of those receivers and to all of the triggerables that the recievers hold (doors has all buttons attached to it)
The HighlightingController script will hold onto the instance of all those new highlights and destroys them when the player exits the triggerable tile.
To work with 2x2 blobs on multiple buttons, it uses a dictionary of the triggable the blob is on and all the highlights spawned by it so it destroys the correct ones when exiting.
