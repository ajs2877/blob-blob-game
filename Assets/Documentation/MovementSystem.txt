The movement system is crucial to our game but it is quite messy when delve into. There are a lot of edge cases.

But in the end, everything is handled by the TrueGrid script in GameController gameobject. 
The TrueGrid script has many method but there are a few you will use most often. They are:

 CanMoveElement - With a given object and direction, this will check if the object can be move into this spot safely. 
                  It has two params for if it should check for blocking object or if it should take into account pushable objects.
                  If pushable objects is being checked, it will call this method on them to see if your passed in object can push
                  the pushable object out of the way to make room.
                  NO ACTUAL MOVEMENT IS BEING DONE WITH THIS METHOD. Call this before calling MoveElement for best results.

 MoveElement - This method is like CanMoveElement except this will actually move the object to the spot. 
               It will also handle moving pushable objects for you as well. 

 GetElementsAtLocation - Returns all elements at a given coordinate. This includes blobs, tiles, walls, etc
 
 GetElementLocation - Returns all positions that an element occupies in the grid. This is a list of coordinates.
 
 CanElementFit - Basically like CanMoveElement except it only tests if a given object can be placed at a spot without colliding with another element.


Now with this in mind, moving a player works by calling CanMoveElement on itself to see if it can move in a direction. 
Then calls MoveElement on itself to actually move and push boulders aside.

Ice Tiles are very tricky. Blobs and Boulders has a script (PlayerControlelr and Boulder) that extends Moveable class and hooks up its methods into their Start and Update method.
This Moveable class works by having the Blobs and boulders keep track of when they stop moving. 
Then once they stop, Moveable will check if they are on an Ice Tile and then call the Ice Tile's TrySlidingObject method.
The Ice Tile will now call MoveElement on the objects if the object's previous direction given to CanMoveElement returns true.
Thus the Ice Tile gives the impression of sliding by having the moving objects trigger the tile every time they stop at the next spot.

All elements that can move to new spaces are given the DirectionVector script at top level gameobject.
DirectionVector will keep track if the element is moving, sliding, and what direction they are moving in (in up, down, left, right directions only)
This script is referenced quite a bit in IceTiles, PlayerController, Moveable, SwitchTile, and in the TrueGrid script as well as it provides very useful info.

ConditionalBlocking script is designed to be overriden by other scripts to add special filtering that may be too difficult to do with tags or layers.
The AllowOnlyBigBlobIn script implements ConditionalBlocking to prevent movement into a tile by any other moveable objects.
The TrueGrid system looks into the gameobject for any component that implements the ConditionalBlocking script to be used for its CanMoveElement and MoveElement method.
